== Overview
Demonstration of Intelligent IoT Gateway on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. The Gateway enables IoT data transformation, routing and real time decision-making at the edge. OpenShift provides secure enterprise-grade container platform to accelerate IoT application delivery. Each component of the demo runs in its own container, thereby, allowing security, scalability and ease of deployment.

This demo uses the CDK platform: learn how to install CDK https://github.com/redhatdemocentral/cdk-install-demo[here]

*Please note: This repository is currently under development and the feature set/components are subject to change without notice*


== Components

* [AMQ and MQTT](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-xpaas/0/paged/red-hat-xpaas-a-mq-image/)
* [Realtime Decision Server](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-xpaas/0/paged/red-hat-xpaas-a-mq-image/)
* [Fuse Integration Services](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-xpaas/version-0/red-hat-xpaas-fuse-integration-services-image/)
* [Apache Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/)
* Simulated Software Sensor

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be satisfied prior to running the demo

* Git client
* Access to an OpenShift environment
* OpenShift Command Line Interface (CLI)

== Setup

Launch the OpenShift Container platform and login OpenShift Command Line. Learn how to install OpenShift Container platform https://github.com/redhatdemocentral/cdk-install-demo[here]. 

Download the iot-ose project in the OpenShift instance:

 [user@localhost ~]$ git clone https://github.com/sabre1041/iot-ose.git


The https://github.com/sabre1041/iot-ose/blob/master/init.sh[init.sh] script automates the provisioning process for the demo. 

 [user@localhost ~]$ ./init.sh
 
 The script triggers asynchronous builds and deployments of AMQ, Decision Server, Fuse Integration Service, PostgreSQL, Zeppelin and Software Sensor components.

== Configure Visualization Tool

Perform the following steps to configure the Zeppelin visualization tool:

1. Login to the OpenShift environment web console, locate the **iot-ose** project. Select the project and locate the *zeppelin* service on the overview page. Next to the service is the exposed HTTP url. Select the URL to launch the Zeppelin web console. 

2. The first step is to configure zeppelin to communicate with the backend database. The integration between the tool and backend services is accomplished through *interpreters*. On the top right corner, locate and hover over the *anonymous* username and select **Interpreter**.

3. Create a new interpreter called *iot-ose* by selecting **Create** on the top right hand corner of the page. Enter **iot-ose** in the name checkbox and select **psql** in the Interpreter dropdown. By selecting *psql*, several name/value pairs are automatically pre populated. Enter the following pairs to modify the default configurations.

| Name  | Value |
|----------|---------|
| postgresql.password	| postgresiot |
| postgresql.url | jdbc:postgresql://postgresql:5432/iot |
| postgresql.user | postgresiot |

Click **Save** to apply the changes

The visualizations are contained in *Notebooks*. A preconfigured base note for the project are available in the *support/zeppelin* folder in a file called [iot-ose.json](support/zeppelin/iot-ose.json).

This notebook can be imported to Zeppelin by selecting the Zeppelin logo on the top left to return to the homepage. Under notebook, select **Import note**. Select **Choose A JSON Here** and navigate to the json file.

Select the **iot-ose** note that is now available under the notebook section. 

Finally, enable the *iot-ose* interpreter created earlier by selecting the gear on the top right corner of the page representing the **interpreter Binding**. Locate the *iot-ose* interpreter and ensure that it is enabled by clicking on the interpreter so that is highlighted in blue. Drag the interpreter the top of the list to ensure that it is placed with a higher precedence than another interpreters. Click **Save** to apply the changes

Execute all visualizations by hitting the play button on the top lefthand corner of the page next to the name of the note.
