== Overview
Demonstration of Intelligent IoT Gateway on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. The Gateway enables IoT data transformation, routing and real time decision-making at the edge. OpenShift provides secure enterprise-grade container platform to accelerate IoT application delivery. Each component of the demo runs in its own container, thereby, allowing security, scalability and ease of deployment.

This demo uses the CDK platform: learn how to install CDK https://github.com/redhatdemocentral/cdk-install-demo[here]

*Please note: This repository is currently under development and the feature set/components are subject to change without notice*


== Core Components
*https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-xpaas/version-0/red-hat-xpaas-fuse-integration-services-image/[Fuse Integration Services]*
Red Hat JBoss Fuse Integration Services provides a set of tools and containerized xPaaS images that enable development, deployment, and management of integration microservices within OpenShift.

* [AMQ and MQTT](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-xpaas/0/paged/red-hat-xpaas-a-mq-image/)
* [Realtime Decision Server](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-xpaas/0/paged/red-hat-xpaas-a-mq-image/)

* [Apache Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/)
* Simulated Software Sensor

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be satisfied prior to running the demo

* Git client
* Access to an OpenShift environment
* OpenShift Command Line Interface (CLI)

== Setup

Launch the OpenShift Container platform and login OpenShift Command Line. Learn how to install OpenShift Container platform https://github.com/redhatdemocentral/cdk-install-demo[here]. 

Download the iot-ose project in the OpenShift instance:

 [user@localhost ~]$ git clone https://github.com/sabre1041/iot-ose.git


The https://github.com/sabre1041/iot-ose/blob/master/init.sh[init.sh] script automates the provisioning process for the demo. 

 [user@localhost ~]$ ./init.sh
 
The init script triggers asynchronous builds and deployments of AMQ, Decision Server, Fuse Integration Service, PostgreSQL, Zeppelin and Software Sensor components. The last step is to configure the Zeppelin visualization tool. Perform https://github.com/ishuverma/iot-ose/tree/master/zeppelin[these instructions] to configure Zeppelin.
